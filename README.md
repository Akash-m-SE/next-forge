# Beskar Forge

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project boilerplate bootstrapped with [`beskar/forge`](https://github.com/beskar-co/forge). It includes everything required to create a new modern application in the Beskar ecosystem, including Typescript, Tailwind, @vercel/og, @next/font, @vercel/analytics and more. It also runs the new Next.js 13 App directory.

First, scaffold the app with:

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/beskar-co/forge
```

Once it is downloaded, run the development server with `yarn dev`, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
