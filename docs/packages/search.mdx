description: How to use the search feature in next-forge.
---

next-forge has a dedicated search package that can be used to search for content in your application. This package is built on top of [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) â€” a powerful, lightweight fuzzy-search library, with zero dependencies.

Once your app becomes larger and the search requirements grow, you'll want to consider using a more robust search solution like [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

## How it works

The `@repo/search` package provides a `createSearch` function that can be used to create a search instance. You simply pass it your data in any array-like format and a set of keys to search by. For example:

```tsx
const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane.doe@example.com' },
];

const search = createSearch(data, {
  keys: ['name', 'email'],
});
```

## Configuration

The search instance has a minimum character length of 1 (so you can search for a single character) and a threshold of 0.3 (so you can search for a partial match). You can modify these values to suit your needs in the `createSearch` function.
