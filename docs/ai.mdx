description: How to use AI in next-forge.
---

next-forge has a pre-configured `ai` package that uses [ai-sdk](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) to provide a simple interface for interacting with AI models.

## Usage

To use the `ai` package, you can import it from the `@repo/ai` package. For example:

```tsx
import { ai } from '@repo/ai';

const response = await ai.generateText({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  prompt: 'Hello, world!',
});
```

## Adding payment agentic capabilities

You can use the `paymentsAgentToolkit` to add payments capabilities to your AI agent for financial services. As next-forge uses Stripe by default, here's an example of how to use it:

```tsx
import { ai } from '@repo/ai';
import { paymentsAgentToolkit } from '@repo/payments/ai';

const response = await ai.generateText({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  tools: {
    ...paymentsAgentToolkit.getTools(),
  },
  maxSteps: 5,
  prompt: 'Create a payment link for a new product called \"Test\" with a price of $100.',
})
```
